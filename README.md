# House-Price-Predictor
A Machine Learning (ML) project. Analyzes historial trends within the Californian housing market and utlizes said analysis to build a model that predicts house prices.
Uses Linear Regression and Gradient Decent to estimate the price of any given house. All methods within the project are annotated and commented.
This project was accomplished without using any ML-specific libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch - It relies solely upon NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Features/Methods
1. Histogram and scatterplot for analysis.
2. Prediction with initial random weights, loss calculation, gradient descent and updating weights (training) function as separate modules
3. A final method that predicts the actual house price by taking in test data and post-training weights.
